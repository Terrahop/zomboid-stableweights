# Stable Weights

## Description

Original [Stable Weights](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2908032256) updated to b42

> This version exposes weight change increase and decrease multipliers in the sandbox options instead of just a single multiplier. By default you gain 50% more weight, and lose 30% less weight.

This is a very simple mod that scales weight gains and losses by an adjustable factor.
I was annoyed by how quickly my characters' weights changed and how finicky staying at
a healthy weight felt, so I decided to make this mod.

This weight change factor can be changed in the sandbox options

## How it Works

Every ten in-game minutes, this mod calculates each player's change in weight, then scales it by a factor that can be set in sandbox options.

## COMPATABILITY

There shouldn't be compatibility issues, but if some crazy mod depends on changes in player weights, it's possible this mod could disrupt it.

You should be able to add this mod to existing saves with no issues.
